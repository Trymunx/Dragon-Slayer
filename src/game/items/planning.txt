Items:

Have a slot to equip in if equipable
  - item has a number of places in those slots it takes up, e.g. 2 for bows
  - player needs slots defined
  - Creatures also need slots defined so they know what items they can use
  - creatures that cannot equip items must be balanced to have appropriate strength and
      useful/valuable drops (e.g. deer dropping antlers, venison, deergut to sell/use)
Have a strength requirement? Some creatures cannot use items because of this?
Have modifiers:   good if these are computed, so would update if you e.g. sharped the item
  - attack damage mod
  - defence mod
  - hp mod?
Have a name:
  - programatic naming?
    + base name (e.g. sword, dagger, shield, coin)
      > different bases have inherent speed that's affected by e.g. balance/weight?
    + material (gold, iron, copper, stone)
Attributes:
  - sharpness
  - balance (closer to handle gives more speed, less power; opposite gives more power but slower)
  - condition (not bluntness, but could be nicked/rusted. Does this affect sharpness?)
  - weight (affects speed, depends on material?)
value:
  - computed aggregator of all properties and attributes to give player quick indicator & sell val



When generating equipped items for a creature, set a creature's value based on its level, then
  start generating random items with value between 1 and creature's value - (already generated items),
  including gold. Will have to work out how to make sure creatures don't end up with > max possible
  items for each slot, e.g. 2 helmets or 3 swords.

To do this, I'll need to loop:
1. select a slot. Bag/items is a slot which has no limit. If creature hasShield, don't give shield
2. get a type for that slot (bear in mind only one shield)
3. get a constrained value
4. generate an item for the slot and value ()

If creature doesn't have slots available, give more experience for higher value, and make drops
  more valuable. E.g. antlers -> big antlers and are worth more gold


Weapons get stronger the longer you use them for, as you learn their unique traits
